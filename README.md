Bidirectional communication for Kaleidoscope. With this plugin, one can expose a
set of commands via the Serial port, and allow the host to talk with the
keyboard - and vice versa. This plugin implements only the basic building
blocks, a framework other plugins can opt-in to.

## Using the plugin

This plugin is **not** meant to be used by the end-user (apart from setting it
up to use plugin-provided hooks), but by plugin authors instead. As an end user,
please see the documentation of the plugins you use, for instructions on how to
hook them up with `Focus`!

Nevertheless, the basic commands we implement with this plugin alone, are usable
like this:

```c++
#include <Kaleidoscope.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-Focus.h>

void setup () {
  Serial.begin (9600);
  Kaleidoscope.setup ();

  USE_PLUGINS (&Focus);

  Focus.addHook (FOCUS_HOOK_HELP);
  Focus.addHook (FOCUS_HOOK_VERSION);
}
```

## Plugin methods

The plugin provides the `Focus` object, which has the following methods:

### `.addHook(FOCUS_HOOK (function, documentation))`

> TODO

### `.getRootNode()`

> TODO
